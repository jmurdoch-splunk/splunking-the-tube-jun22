There are four snippets of Splunk Add-on Builder code here:
* London Underground: line status
* London Underground: line arrivals
* London Underground: line routes
* National Rail: station departures

Notes:
* Code is purely for reference, has limited good practice, etc.
* Widgets need to be created for the options to function.
* National Rail needs an API key.
* London Underground does not need an API key, but having one will permit more requests.
